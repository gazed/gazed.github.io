<h1>Go For Gamedev 2025.</h1>

<p>Go can absolutely be used for gamedev and has been since Go was released in 2012.
While the number of golang gamedevs and game projects has slowly grown,
I propose three explanations, philosophical, practical, and technical,
potentially showing a way to making Go gamedev even more popular.</p>

<h3>Philosophical</h3>

<p>The philosophical explanation is perfectly presented in Rob Pike&rsquo;s
<a href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html">Less is exponentially more</a>.
A great article which answers why games should be developed using Go.
All the reasons for creating Go, and all the benefits of Go, also apply to gamedev coding.</p>

<p>Moreover, the key point of the article discusses why C++ [game engine] devs do not switch to Go,
and it has to do with <em>&ldquo;Do you think less is more, or less is less?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>I think Go&rsquo;s &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; view point would initially lead to the
creation of high-value packages for the essential gamedev libraries.
My own golang hobby engine<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> is a wish list of the core functionality
that I would love to see supported in pure Go, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>asset loading - be selective: png for images, glfw for models, etc.</li>
<li>linear math library - 64 bit to work with golang math.</li>
<li>platform library - think <a href="https://glfw.org">glfw</a> written in Go.</li>
<li>gpu api library - start with the Vulkan API generated from the spec.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall my experience of creating small games in UnrealEngine and my own
golang engine<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> has reinforced my belief that the gamedev community would
benefit tremendously from some &ldquo;less is exponentially more&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Practical</h3>

<p>The philosophical leads to the first practical consideration, and it is the need
for core gamedev devs. These devs understand &ldquo;less is exponentially more&rdquo; and are
supported by company $$$ to allow the creation and maintenance of the golang core
gamedev packages.  Every few years, like a gopher, I pop my head up and look around,
but they seem to be absent. Historically, three devs are needed to get things going.</p>

<p>The second practical consideration is that coding can be a very small part
of the total gamedev process. Go does not directly help with:</p>

<ul>
<li>game design</li>
<li>level design</li>
<li>3D modelling and animation</li>
<li>narrative design and dialog</li>
<li>audio design, capture, and editing</li>
<li>2D art and textures</li>
</ul>

<p>Even with code being a small part of overall game production there are substantial
efforts being made to reduce coding effort by providing visual scripting languages
like Blueprints in Unreal Engine. I argue here that Go is, by design, exactly what
can help improve the gamedev code experience. Go for game code as well as game engines.</p>

<h3>Technical</h3>

<p>One of the challenges in creating the core gamedev packages is the technical issue
I&rsquo;ve seen referred to as the <em>golang impedance problem</em>.
Currently many golang gamedev packages require <code>cgo</code> to interface
with non-golang libraries like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vulkan GPU API</li>
<li>Platform API</li>
<li>Audio API</li>
</ul>

<p>I find wrapping <code>C</code> API&rsquo;s with <code>cgo</code> frustrating. Frustrating to the point that
it is easier in the long term to port the essential parts of existing open source
libraries to Go packages. Another benefit of porting is that it can be selective
in the &ldquo;less is exponentially more&rdquo; sense.</p>

<p>Ideally there is no C compiler in the gamedev tech stack (I&rsquo;m spoiled, I know, and don&rsquo;t forget lazy).
Recently I reduced my game engine support to win64 which allowed me to replace <code>cgo</code> with syscalls.
Coding became noticeably more enjoyable once it was golang only.</p>

<p>My thinking is that the technical impedance problems are solvable.
How much time and effort would need be clarified.
For example, is it even possible to write a golang Vulkan API layer without wrappers?
Probably? Does it make sense? Worth the effort? Heck yes, I would love it if a Vulkan golang
package popped up one day.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Go game development is slowly growing but needs some core work to become a viable
alternative for new gamedev coders. Existing technical issues can solved with
some practical time, effort, $$$ and the &ldquo;less is exponentially more&rdquo; passion.
In the meantime golang gamedev as a hobby is fantastic!</p>
