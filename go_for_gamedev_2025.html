<h1>Go Gamedev State 2025.</h1>

<p>Go can absolutely be used for gamedev and has been since Go was released in 2012.
While the number of golang gamedevs and game projects has slowly grown,
I propose three explanations, philosophical, practical, and technical,
as to why Go gamedev is not even more popular.</p>

<h3>Philosophical</h3>

<p>The philosophical explanation is perfectly presented in Rob Pike&rsquo;s
<a href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html">Less is exponentially more</a>.
A great article which answers why games should be developed using Go.
It is for the same reasons that Go was created.</p>

<p>Moreover, the key point of the article discusses why C++ [game engine] devs do not switch to Go,
and it has to do with <em>&ldquo;Do you think less is more, or less is less?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>I think Go&rsquo;s world view would naturally lead to an initial focus on the game dev essentials.
My own golang hobby engine<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> is a wish list of the core functionality
that I would love to see supported in pure Go, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>asset loading - be selective: png for images, glfw for models, etc.</li>
<li>linear math library - 64 bit to work with golang math.</li>
<li>platform library - think <a href="https://glfw.org">glfw</a> written in Go.</li>
<li>gpu api library - start with the Vulkan API generated from the spec.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall my experience of creating small games in UnrealEngine and my own
golang engine<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> has reinforced my belief that the game dev community would
benefit tremendously from some &ldquo;less is exponentially more&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Practical</h3>

<p>The philosophical leads to the first practical consideration. Where are the
core game dev devs that understand &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; and have the company $$$
support to create and maintain the golang game dev packages?
Every few years, like a gopher, I pop my head up and look around.
I&rsquo;m hoping they are there, but I missed finding them. Anyone?</p>

<p>The second practical reason is that coding can be a very small part of the total
game dev process. As such the benefits of coding in Go are muted since code
can not directly help with:</p>

<ul>
<li>game design</li>
<li>level design</li>
<li>3D modelling and animation</li>
<li>narrative design and dialog</li>
<li>audio design, capture, and editing</li>
<li>2D art and textures</li>
</ul>

<p>The result is that small games can be coded in any language,
including visual scripting languages like Blueprints in Unreal Engine.
Coding being a small part of the game dev effort can be an argument for using Go
since any extra effort needed for Go is a small part of the overall game release time.</p>

<h3>Technical</h3>

<p>I think of the technical issue as the <em>golang impedence problem</em>.
Currently many golang game dev packages require <code>cgo</code> to interface
with non-golang libraries like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vulkan GPU API</li>
<li>Platform API</li>
<li>Audio API</li>
</ul>

<p>I find wrapping native API&rsquo;s with <code>cgo</code> frustrating.
Frustrating to the point that, where possible, it is easier in the long term to port
the essential parts of existing open source libraries to Go packages.</p>

<p>Ideally there is no C compiler in the game dev tech stack (I&rsquo;m spoiled, I know, and don&rsquo;t forget lazy).
Recently I reduced my game engine support to win64 which allowed me to replace <code>cgo</code> with syscalls.
Coding became noticably more enjoyable once it was golang only.</p>

<p>My thinking is that the technical impedence problems are solvable.
How much time and effort would need be clarified.
For example, is it even possible to write a golang Vulkan API layer without wrappers?
Maybe. Does it make sense? Worth the effort?
Would love it if one just appeared though.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Go game development is slowly growing but needs more work to become a viable
alternative for new game dev coders. Existing technical issues can solved with
some practical time, effort and $$$. In the meantime golang game dev as a hobby is fantastic!</p>
