<a id="user-content-build-script-notes" class="anchor" href="#build-script-notes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build Script Notes</h1>

<p>Notes, neat things, and gotchas about building and packaging a Go
executable for the Mac App Store. This is based on the bampf project
build at <a href="https://github.com/gazed/bampf/blob/master/build">https://github.com/gazed/bampf/blob/master/build</a></p>

<a id="user-content-notes" class="anchor" href="#notes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The build script was written in Python as it either already available or
easily installed on OS X, Windows, and Linux. Python is mainly used to
execute the individual shell commands needed to create the final product.</li>
<li>The build script attempts to be maintainable in two ways:
first, it is kept short at around 150 lines, and second many
of the individual commands can be tested simply by pasting
from the script to the command line.</li>
<li>Tools other than go were needed for the final OS X Application. The OS X
command line tools are needed for compiling, Xcode was used to create
developer signing keys, and OS X Application Loader was used to submit the
executable for App store approval.</li>
<li>Product resources, like icons, are stored in the
<a href="https://github.com/gazed/bampf/tree/master/src"><code>bampf/src</code></a> directory.
This seemed a handy place to keep product related stuff without cluttering
the top directory, <code>bampf</code>, or the code directory, <code>bampf/src/bampf</code>.</li>
</ul>

<a id="user-content-neat-things" class="anchor" href="#neat-things" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Neat things</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<code>buildBinary (line 53)</code>: Its nice to be able to inject a version number into
the executable during the build. In this case the version comes from source
control tags, git for this project, combined with the go build -X flag.</li>
<li>
<code>buildWindows (line 110)</code>: Sometimes it can be easier to ship a single executable.
Zip was used combine the game resources with the go executable into a single binary.
At runtime, the go executable is able to open itself to read the zipped resources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-gotchas" class="anchor" href="#gotchas" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gotchas</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<code>buildOSX (line 68)</code>: Needed <code>-linkmode=external</code> build flag as Apple looks
for some system specific fields in the executable. Details in go issue 6198.</li>
<li>
<code>buildOSX (lines 73-80)</code>: Mac applications need to conform to a particular
directory structure.</li>
<li>
<code>buildOSX (lines 88-93)</code>: Mac applications have a particular file mode that
can copied from an existing Mac app.</li>
<li>Application signing is a must. Add the following lines at the end of the <code>buildOSX</code>
method. Edit to replace <code>XXX</code> and <code>YYY</code> with the names of your developer OS X keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>Caveats: while the script can also build a Windows executable when on a
windows OS, it is not at the point where the application can be submitted
to the Windows App store. Also Linux builds are stubbed at the moment.</p>
