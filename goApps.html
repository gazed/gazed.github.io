<h2>
Go Library Support for Apps and Games.
</h2>

<p>
The library support to be able to ship applications and games written in Go
is not at the same level as that enjoyed by back-end web development.
My current work as a game developer, and wanna-be application creator depends on
<p>
<ul>
    <li>packages supporting game development.</li>
    <li>packages supporting a cross-platform GUI.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These are library issues, nicely separate from the Go language.
My experience of using Go for game development is that the Go language
is great - no changes necessary.
</p>

<h3>
Writing Games in Go.
</h3>

<p>
(1) What I wanted to do:
</p>
<div class="indent">
    I wanted to write and ship games using Go.
</div>

<p>
(2) What I actually did:
</p>
<div class="indent">
    <p>
    I wrote a game engine using Go (<a href="https://github.com/gazed/vu">https://github.com/gazed/vu</a>)
    which allows me to create games using Go. This involved:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>writing device layer go bindings for macOS, iOS, and windows to
            get access to the display and user input.</li>
        <li>writing OpenGL, and OpenAL go bindings.</li>
        <li>writing a vector, matrix, and quaternion math library in Go.</li>
        <li>porting some of Bullet Physics to Go.</li>
        <li>writing a basic asset import library.</li>
        <li>writing the game engine layer.</li>
    </ul>
    Then I wrote a games using Go, eg: <a href="http://jewelofkings.com">http://jewelofkings.com</a>.
    <ul>
        <li>In order to publish I wrote a packaging script (python this time) to be able to
          ship to the macOS app store, the iOS store, and windows 10 app store.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<p>
(3) Why that wasn't great.
<div class="indent">
    </p>
    For each of the above bulleted items I was hoping that there was already a
    package available. A package that had been produced, reviewed and used by
    100's or 1000's of developers. My preference is to not depend on packages
    created by one or two developers - including those I write myself.
    My packages haven't been reviewed by anyone else and, unlike
    the go library packages, there can be no expectation of ongoing support.
    </p>

<h3>
Writing Applications in Go.
</h3>

<p>
(1) What I wanted to do:
</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>
I want to write and ship desktop applications using Go. Specifically tools
to help with game development like <a href="http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont">http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont</a>
and eventually a game level editor.
</p>
</div>

<p>
(2,3) What I actually did, and why that wasn't great.
</p>
<div class="indent">
    <p>
    This hasn't happened yet because it relies on an underlying cross-platform GUI.
    I've looked at a few strategies and attempted a few implementations but failed
    at finding a Go-based approach that I can do by myself in a reasonble time frame.
    I'm looking for something, anything, similar to other cross-platform examples
    available using other languages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Java: AWT, SWT, Swing.
        </li>
        <li>C/C++: Qt, GTK+, wxWidgets.
        </li>
        <li>Javascript, HTML5, CSS: Chromium Embeded Framework.
        </li>
        <li>Custom OpenGL based UI like Blender.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
