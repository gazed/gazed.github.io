<h1>Go Gamedev State 2025.</h1>

<p>Go game development has grown since 2012. Overall still small, but noticably bigger.
I base this opinion on my game dev hobby experience which started in 2012
when I wanted learn a little about both go and game dev by writing a 3D game.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
The hobby continued over the years and every so often, like a gopher,
I pop my head up and look around.</p>

<p>The first thing I look for is 3D golang game engines, or golang support in existing game engines.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>azul3d</strong> was one of the early engines, but it seems to have gone away.</li>
<li><strong>g3n</strong> looks good. Not much activity in the last few years.</li>
<li><strong>harfang3D</strong> has go support <a href="https://github.com/harfang3d/harfang-go">harfang-go</a>. Not much activity in the last few years.</li>
<li><strong>bgfx</strong> render library has the start of a golang wrapper.</li>
<li><strong>ebiten</strong> appears to be a popular supported 2D golang engine. There&rsquo;s been some requests to add 3D.</li>
</ul>

<p>The encouraging point is that things are happening, even if it is on a small scale.
Why is there not more going on? Golang game dev questions regularly pop up on reddit
and my attempt to summarize the explanations fall into three substantial categories:
the philosophical, the practical, and the technical.</p>

<h3>Philosophical</h3>

<p>The philosophical arguments deals with programming world views summed up in Rob Pike&rsquo;s
<a href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html">Less is exponentially more</a>
For me, it beautifully answers &ldquo;Why develop games in Go?. For the same reasons Go was created.
At the same time, it also answers &ldquo;why c++ game developers are not switching to go&rdquo;.</p>

<p>My experience of creating small games in UnrealEngine<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> and my own <code>golang</code> hobby engine<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
has only reinforced my belief that the game dev community would benefit tremendously from
a good dose of &ldquo;less is exponentially more&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Practical</h3>

<p>The first practical consideration is that it would likely take a group of dedicated+experienced devs,
a bunch of time, and even some $$$ to get get a serious <code>golang</code> engine off the ground.
I feel a good example of this is the <code>Godot</code> engine (sounds like it should be written in Go, no?).</p>

<p>The second practical reason can be summed as &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t really needed&rdquo;. This is less
to do with the amount of existing 3D engines, and more because the coding part
in game dev can be a very small portion of the work. This is true even for small games,
as I find myself spending less time coding (thanks to <code>golang</code> for making it enjoyable)
and more time on the other things necessary to create and ship a game:</p>

<ul>
<li>game design</li>
<li>level design</li>
<li>3D modelling and animation (ok, I&rsquo;m basically still making games with blocks and spheres)</li>
<li>narrative design and dialog (not a writer either)</li>
<li>audio design, capture, and editing (had to pay for help with this)</li>
<li>2D art and textures (and this)</li>
</ul>

<p>The end result is that you get to choose whatever language you want for game development
because it only affects a small portion of your overall effort. Mostly your game code
involves &ldquo;scripting&rdquo; which, for small games, can be done in UnrealEngines <code>Blueprints</code>,
avoiding C++ programming entirely. In this light I can see my non-engine go game dev
coding as &ldquo;scripting&rdquo; using <code>go</code> - and its very enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Technical</h3>

<p>I think of the technical issue as the &ldquo;golang impedence problem&rdquo;.
the impedence problem is that golang game dev absolutely requires interfacing with
non-golang libraries like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vulkan API</li>
<li>Platform API for the render display and the user input. Think <a href="https://glfw.org">glfw</a></li>
<li>Audio API</li>
</ul>

<p>I found wrapping the native API&rsquo;s with <code>cgo</code> to be a bit frustrating.
The more wrapping the more frustrating, to the point where I found it was
easier to port some open source code rather than wrapping it.</p>

<ul>
<li>physics library - originally based on a small part of the bullet engine core, currently based on <em><a href="https://github.com/felipeek/raw-physics">https://github.com/felipeek/raw-physics</a></em></li>
<li>linear math library - its been awhile, I think this was based on the original opengl math library.</li>
<li>asset loading - prefer <em><a href="https://github.com/qmuntal/gltf">https://github.com/qmuntal/gltf</a></em> to wrapping a C asset load library.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to add a C compiler to my tech stack (I&rsquo;m spoiled, I know, and don&rsquo;t forget lazy).
Ideally I want to code in <code>go</code> and nothing else. I ended up only supporting win64 in my engine,
which allowed me to replace <code>cgo</code> with syscalls. Whether or not this is a good idea,
coding became noticably more enjoyable once it was <code>go</code> only.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always hoping someone else solves this problem, either by porting the stuff that
can be ported or finding some ultimate solution that is likely lower level than I&rsquo;m comfortable with.
For example could the tool <a href="https://github.com/minio/c2goasm">c2goasm</a> help me generate API layers?
Don&rsquo;t know, just discovered this one today. Is it even possible to write the Vulkan API layer in <code>go</code>?
Maybe. Does it make sense? Worth the effort? Maybe not. Would love it if one just appeared though.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Go game development is slowly growing but is a long way from being a viable alternative
for new game dev coders. As a hobby, its fantastic!</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn:1"><p><a href="https://github.com/gazed/bampf">Bampf</a> was created to test my initial attempt at a hobby game engine.
  Please don&rsquo;t look, both the game and engine were bad in multiple ways. The game is deprecated and
  would only work work with an ancient verion of the engine.</p></li>

<li id="fn:2"><p><a href="https://shootffs.com">SFFS</a> There are so many problems with this game.
  First off its a non-violent shooter, which has a market base of no-one.
  Add in my poor reuse of UE assets and my crappy animations and you have a bad game,
  but a really good learning experience about some of the strengths and weakness
  of both UnrealEngine (to many things to add here) and my game dev
  abilities (I enjoy coding, not modelling or animating).</p></li>

<li id="fn:3"><p><a href="https://floworlds.com">Floworlds</a> Better. First game on the most recent <code>golang</code>
  <a href="https://github.com/gazed/vu">vu engine</a> which removed <code>cgo</code> and swapped
  out <code>OpenGL</code> for <code>Vulkan</code>.</p></li>
